# DICE Companion
DICE Companion is a web application that aims to enable boardgame players to take more out of the boardgame hobby by providing a platform for them to find boardgame events and schedule game sessions with friends and other members of the community. This is an ever growing project and therefore you are more then encouraged to contribute to it.

## Solution Architecture
The DICE Companion App is a web application that is composed of a frontend and a backend. The frontend is a React application that is served by a Node.js server. The backend is a .Net WebAPI that is responsible for serving the frontend and providing the API that the frontend consumes. The backend is also responsible for communicating with the database and other services that the application might need.

Here is a diagram of the present Architecture
